- Category: #articles
- Summary: The text covers a standard PyTorch workflow for building and training models, including creating linear regression models and making predictions. It emphasizes the importance of subclassing nn.Module for creating neural network models in PyTorch. Additionally, it discusses key steps like setting up loss functions, optimizers, training loops, and saving/loading models for inference.

- the above is a good default order but you may see slightly different orders. Some rules of thumb:
  • Calculate the loss (`loss = ...`) *before* performing backpropagation on it (`loss.backward()`).
  • Zero gradients (`optimizer.zero_grad()`) *before* stepping them (`optimizer.step()`).
  • Step the optimizer (`optimizer.step()`) *after* performing backpropagation on the loss (`loss.backward()`). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j17d64c4z6rcm1mz4jw3fths))
- Why call `torch.load()` inside `torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict()`?
  Because we only saved the model's `state_dict()` which is a dictionary of learned parameters and not the *entire* model, we first have to load the `state_dict()` with `torch.load()` and then pass that `state_dict()` to a new instance of our model (which is a subclass of `nn.Module`).
  Why not save the entire model?
  [Saving the entire model](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#save-load-entire-model) rather than just the `state_dict()` is more intuitive, however, to quote the PyTorch documentation (italics mine):
  > The disadvantage of this approach *(saving the whole model)* is that the serialized data is bound to the specific classes and the exact directory structure used when the model is saved...
  > 
  > Because of this, your code can break in various ways when used in other projects or after refactors.
  So instead, we're using the flexible method of saving and loading just the `state_dict()`, which again is basically a dictionary of model parameters. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j197c1m3wd78s3chxwgyfygg))
