## Highlights
- Streaming works well with React's component model, as each component can be considered a *chunk*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hy4w09zkemgqk1zrsr0czh2w))
- `loading.tsx` is a special Next.js file built on top of Suspense, it allows you to create fallback UI to show as a replacement while page content loads. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hy4w9kayyp6xqv5hhmpcj5jc))
- A loading skeleton is a simplified version of the UI. Many websites use them as a placeholder (or fallback) to indicate to users that the content is loading. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hy4w634pec5vbtajp8801h8b))
- Route groups allow you to organize files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure. When you create a new folder using parentheses `()`, the name won't be included in the URL path. So `/dashboard/(overview)/page.tsx` becomes `/dashboard`.
