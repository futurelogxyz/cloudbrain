## Highlights
- **sampling rate** (also called sampling frequency) is the number of samples taken in one second and is measured in hertz (Hz) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8jn59sxksdy6bys30z0y6mq))
- sampling rate primarily determines the highest frequency that can be captured from the signal. This is also known as the Nyquist limit and is exactly half the sampling rate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8jn67b0q2cfv8efpjwtf920))
- **amplitude** of a sound describes the sound pressure level at any given instant and is measured in decibels (dB) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8jnd89nztagmzftwe188qpa))
- The **bit depth** of the sample determines with how much precision this amplitude value can be described ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8jnfaw3nh5hq6bsxcmwedj8))
