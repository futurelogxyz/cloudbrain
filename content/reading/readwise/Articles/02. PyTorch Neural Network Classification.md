- Full Title: 02. PyTorch Neural Network Classification
- Category: #articles
- Summary: The text discusses building PyTorch classification models, preparing data as tensors, and training models with different optimizers and loss functions. It also covers evaluating model predictions, creating multi-class models, and training loops for improving model performance.

## Highlights
- If a loss function measures how *wrong* your model is, I like to think of evaluation metrics as measuring how *right* it is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1scayxj8bethb7z98kc4021))
- the raw outputs of our model are often referred to as [**logits**](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/31045). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j4r1tjet8g8s1s5r989j8mwe))
- Out of 100 predictions, how many does your model get correct? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1xwjfnpcnzm71re95399v5k))
    - Note: accuracy
- Precision Proportion of true positives over total number of samples. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1xwfmt314306kb8j3s9e971))
