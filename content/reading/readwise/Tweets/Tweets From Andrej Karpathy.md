## Highlights
- New (2h13m ðŸ˜…) lecture: "Let's build the GPT Tokenizer"
  Tokenizers are a completely separate stage of the LLM pipeline: they have their own training set, training algorithm (Byte Pair Encoding), and after training implement two functions: encode() from strings to tokens, and decode() back from tokens to strings. In this lecture we build from scratch the Tokenizer used in the GPT series from OpenAI.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGzDVPMasAAtLs0.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1759996549109776702))
